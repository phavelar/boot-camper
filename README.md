boot-camper
===========

A collection (work in progress) of sample projects using Spring Boot and Other Goodies

##The first project is camp-rest-assured

The main point of this first example, is to ilustrate how simple and cool it is to create a REST API
using Spring Boot and test the API using my favorite REST test library, Rest-Assured.
My preference is not to use XML for configuring spring beans.

You can learn more about REST assured here: https://code.google.com/p/rest-assured/

You can learn more about Spring Boot here: http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/
  
Notice how the representation (Song in the example) is validated during a POST.  

To Run the tests, either do it from Maven:  ```mvn test```  or point your IDE to SongsResourceTest and run as Junit test.
